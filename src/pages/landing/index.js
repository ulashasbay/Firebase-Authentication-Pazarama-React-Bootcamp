          Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a
          stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content.
          It is one of the most popular drinks in the world and can be prepared
          and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press,
          caff√® latte, or already-brewed canned coffee).
